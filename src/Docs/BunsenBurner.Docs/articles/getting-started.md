# Getting Started

To use this library, simply include `BunsenBurner.dll` in your project or grab
it from [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/BunsenBurner/), and add this to
the top of each test `.cs` file
that needs it:

```C#
using static BunsenBurner.Aaa; // For Arrange act assert
```

or

```C#
using static BunsenBurner.Bdd; // For Given when then
```
