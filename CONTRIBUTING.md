# How to Contribute

First check to see if the issue/feature already exists.

If not create an issue, outline the scope of the requirement.

Once the issue is aired and groomed, create a fork and work through the implementation.

Building the solution will install commit hooks to enforce the basic standards.

Have fun :smile:
